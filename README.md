# CS3388 Computer Graphics

This repository contains a series of assignments for a computer graphics course, focusing on different aspects of OpenGL programming in C++. Each assignment is designed to introduce and practice specific concepts in computer graphics, ranging from simple drawings to complex 3D mesh generation.

## Assignment Summaries

### Assignment 1: Introduction to OpenGL

- Objective: Learn the basics of OpenGL by drawing a simple triangle.
- Key Concepts: Creating a window, setting its dimensions, and drawing shapes using vertices.
- Compilation: Use g++ HelloWorld.cpp -lOpenGL -lglfw.
### Assignment 2: Drawing with OpenGL

- Objective: Utilize OpenGL to draw images and shapes based on user input and algorithms.
- Key Concepts: Drawing poly-line images, handling rotation, generating dot plots with random algorithms.
- Details: This assignment includes exercises like drawing a dog poly-line image and creating a dot plot with specified parameters.
### Assignment 3: Cubic Bezier Spline Tool

- Objective: Implement a tool for creating and manipulating cubic Bezier splines.
- Key Concepts: Spline creation, point manipulation, rendering techniques.
- Features: The tool allows users to add points, create splines, and visualize the resulting curve.
### Assignment 4: 3D Transformations and Lighting

- Objective: Understand and apply 3D transformations, lighting, and camera control.
- Key Concepts: Transformation matrices, lighting models, camera movement.
- Implementation: Focus on manipulating objects in 3D space and simulating realistic lighting.
### Assignment 5: Marching Cubes Algorithm

- Objective: Generate 3D triangular meshes from scalar fields using the Marching Cubes algorithm.
- Key Concepts: Mesh generation, camera controls, shading, PLY file output.
- Usage: Control the camera to orbit around the generated mesh, with support for vertex normals computation and sample 3D functions.
## Installation and Setup

Each assignment requires a C++ compiler and specific libraries including OpenGL, GLFW, GLM, and GLEW. Follow the installation instructions provided in each assignment's README for detailed setup and compilation instructions.
